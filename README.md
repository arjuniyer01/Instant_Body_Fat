# Instant_Body_Fat
Creating a thumb rule to instantly estimate one's body fat percentage using multiple regression model in R. 

## Goal
The goal of the project is to come up with a simple and accurate way of determining body fat percentage of males based on readily available clinical measurements.

## Results

RULE OF THUMB:

BodyFat\% = AbdomenCirc.-(Weight/6)-42

**Example:** A male individual that weight 160 lbs and has abdomen circumference 88 cm, yields a body fat % of about 19%.
